Check a repository that I am building [MT_Oil](https://github.com/attackgnome/MT_Oil) that provides some guidance on utilizing data from the Montana Board of Oil & Gas Conservation. My interest in this data set came from the several years I spent working as a field engineer specializing in hydraulic fracturing in the Williston Basin during the [Bakken oil boom] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_oil_boom).

Over time I am planning to integrate in information from [FracFocus](https://www.fracfocus.org/) which will allow some visibility into the materials that were pumped into wells in the state. 

Moonshot goals are to scrape the pdf well files and grab completion and well testing data.
