Hi, I'm Joseph Romani, Technical Advisor at Halliburton with our PE Digital Group. I use tools like python, R, and SQL to analyze data, create machine learning models, and build control systems. I worked in the energy industry for over a decade in various engineering and operations roles, but have been focused on extracting value from data since 2017
